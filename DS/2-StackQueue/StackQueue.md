# Stack & Queues

## Stack
LIFO - Last In First Out Container
- `Push` to add items to the stack (at the top)
- `Pop` to remove items from the stack (at the top)

## Queue
FIFO - First In First Out Container
- `Enqueue` to add (at the tail of the queue)
- `Dequeue` to remove (at the head of the queue)

## Doubly Ended Queue (deque)
- A queue like container which is both LIFO and FIFO
- We can add or remove item from the head or tail
