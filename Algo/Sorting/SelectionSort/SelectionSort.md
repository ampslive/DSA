# Selection Sort

- The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

### Steps
- Selection sort is similar to Insertion sort in which it contains two subarrays... sorted and unsorted.
- At the first pass... sorted array is considered as 0 and unsorted array as the length of the input
- At every pass, the smallest value is `selected` and inserted at the front of the array
