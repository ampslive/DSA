# Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm where the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
- Insertion sort is considered as an optimisation of Bubble sort since it avoids comparing with every element.

### Steps

- First element is considered as sorted and the remaining elements are considered as unsorted. 
- On each pass of the unsorted part, the element is compared with elements in the sorted part and placed accordingly
