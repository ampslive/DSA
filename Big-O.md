# Big-O Notation
- Big-O notations represent the worst case scenario of an alogrithm in terms of cost (upper-bound)
- Big-Omega notation represent the best case scenario of an algorith in terms of cost (lower-bound)

## O(1)
Fixed time algorithm which takes the same time irrespective of input size

## O(n)
Iterating over a collection of data once often indicates an O(n) algorithm.

## O(log n)
- A function whose cost scales logarithmically with the input size
- These algorithms divide the input data into halves

## O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- A function that exhibits quadratic growth relative to the input size
- Doubly nested loop is an indication of these algortihms

## O(nm)
- A function which has two inputs that contribute to the cost
- A nested loop that iterates over two distinct collections of data is an indication of these algortihms
